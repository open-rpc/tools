  "description": "## Semantics\n\n`x-implemented-by` declares which logical participant(s) are responsible for handling a JSON-RPC method.\n\nA participant listed in `x-implemented-by` is expected to receive and process inbound requests for that method. Participants not listed are not expected to handle inbound requests.\n\nIf `x-implemented-by` is omitted, tooling **SHOULD** assume `[\"server\"]` for backward compatibility with existing OpenRPC documents.\n\n## Tooling Behavior (recommended)\n\n- Tools operating as a given participant SHOULD accept inbound requests only for methods where `x-implemented-by` includes that participant.\n- Tools MAY expose outbound helpers or emitters for methods implemented by other participants.\n- Documentation tooling SHOULD group or label methods by their `x-implemented-by` value.\n- Mock tooling MAY provide mechanisms to manually trigger methods implemented by other participants.\n\n## Conventions\n\n- Common role identifiers include `server` and `client`.\n- Role identifiers are free-form strings and are not restricted to a fixed vocabulary.\n- Tools MUST treat unknown role identifiers as valid labels.",
