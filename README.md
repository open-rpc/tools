# Using nvm

This project uses `nvm` to manage Node.js versions. To use the correct Node.js version, run the following command in the root of the repository and in each package directory:

```sh
nvm use
```

If you do not have the required Node.js version installed, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
nvm install
```
